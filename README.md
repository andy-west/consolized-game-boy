## Description
This is a modified version of Andy West's project from *element14 Presents* episode 531: "Game Guy - The Unportable Game Boy".  

Notable changes:
 - Single Pico!
 - Using RGB222 Video to free up GPIO (with the limited color schemes, I doubt anyone would notice!)
 - All pins have been remapped; this was done mostly to make things easier to route PCB traces
 - 3x scale maintaining aspect ratio
 - Option to enable scanlines, pixel effect, etc.
 - The Color scheme, border, effects can be changed via a menu overlay
 - V3 SGB Cart version fits inside a NESPi case
 - Custom PCBs
 - With Version 3 PCB, you won't need a functioning Gameboy motherboard.  You just need a good CPU and RAM (you could even use CPU/RAM from a Super Gameboy SNES/Famicom cartridge)

Andy liked my modifications and made an updated video where he built one with my changes :)
